export const SPEED_READING_SCRIPT = `Let's see if you can keep up with this speed reading exercise. We'll kick things off at 300 words per minute. The average person reads around 200 to 250 words per minute so you're already reading faster than most people. Anyway let's give 360 words per minute a go. The main trick with this kind of speed reading is all about quieting the voice in your head. This voice reads every single word aloud. That's the main habit that slows us all down. Think of it like taking the training wheels off a bike. At first it feels strange but soon you find your balance. The idea here is to let your eyes do the work. Just absorb the words as they appear on screen. Most of us learned to read at a certain pace and just never updated that skill. So how does this actually work? The technique we're using is called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. The idea behind it is really simple. Instead of your eyes having to move across a page the words are rapidly presented to you one at a time. Your eyes don't move smoothly when you read normally. They make tiny jumps and stops. These small movements are what take up most of your reading time. By getting rid of them you naturally start to process information much faster. You'll notice there's a red letter in each word. That's your focal point. It acts as an anchor for your eyes. This helps your brain to lock onto the word and recognize it almost instantly. You don't need to scan the whole thing. It's a cool energy trick that makes a huge difference. Before we all got Artificial Intelligence to do our work for us speed reading was a key skill. Even if it's not as vital for work it's still a fun little cognitive workout. It helps you learn faster and enjoy reading more. With consistent practice you can train your brain to process information at a much higher rate. Start with a comfortable speed and gradually increase it. The goal is not just to see the words but to absorb their meaning effortlessly. You might be surprised at how quickly your reading speed and comprehension can improve. Think of this as a complete workout for your brain. You're training several key skills at once. For starters you're building serious focus. To keep up with this speed your brain has to lock in and ignore distractions. It's like a form of meditation. You are literally training your attention muscle. It also exercises your working memory when you're pushing to connect ideas more rapidly. Your visual processing also gets a massive upgrade. You train your brain to see whole words as pictures not just letters. And maybe most importantly you're practicing self control by actively telling that reading voice in your head to stay quiet. This can even make reading less tiring over long periods. But here's the most important thing to remember it only counts if you understand what you're reading. Speed is great but comprehension is the real goal. As you push the speed check in with yourself. After a long paragraph pause and ask yourself what you just read. If you can't say you're going too fast. The aim is to find that sweet spot where you're reading faster than ever but not missing a thing. If you can read this then you're doing pretty well. This is more than twice the speed of the average reader. Either you're a genius or you've had way too much coffee today. Or perhaps you're unlocking a natural ability that has been dormant all this time. The human brain's capacity for visual processing is immense. It far exceeds the speed at which we can speak. Think about how you recognize company logos or street signs. You see them as a whole image you don't spell out the letters. You see the word stop and your brain gets the message instantly. That's the very same principle we're applying to all words now. Training your mind to see them as complete images to be recognized not as a sequential string of letters to be sounded out. This is the fundamental leap from phonetic reading to ideographic comprehension. As you get faster you might enter a state of flow where everything feels automatic. Keep that momentum going. Don't allow your brain to second guess itself or slip back into old habits. Trust your eyes and let the information flow. Don't worry if you miss a word here and there. Your brain is great at filling in the blanks from context. Let's push it one last time for the final sprint. Are you ready for the final challenge? Welcome to 900 words per minute. This is where speed reading starts to transform into something else entirely. We are now approaching the very edge of human reading performance. It is completely normal if the text becomes a blur or feels overwhelming. Very few people can truly comprehend new information at this speed on the first second or even tenth try. Please do not feel discouraged. The goal here is not perfect understanding. The goal is to push your brain's limits and see what it feels like to operate at this incredible pace. Speed reading like this has a specific purpose. You would not use it to enjoy a novel or study a textbook for the first time. Instead think of it as a tool for skimming. You could load a long report into the reader and blast through it at this speed to find the section you need or fly through documents to find a specific piece of information. If you are able to catch even some of these words it means your brain has switched from reading to predicting. You are no longer processing each word individually. Instead you are using the context of the previous words to anticipate what comes next and your brain confirms its guess as the word flashes into view. It's the same way you can finish a friend's sentence or predict the next note in a song you love. You are witnessing your brain's amazing pattern matching abilities operating at the highest level. This is a powerful demonstration of neuroplasticity your brain is literally building faster pathways in real time. As a reward for sticking with me on this challenge I would love to hear about your experience. Was it just a blur or could you pick out key phrases? At what speed did it feel like you were guessing instead of reading? Check out our app in the App Store to speed read any article on X or on Safari.`;
