## Script 1: "200 pages the night before the exam" (Student)

### Slide 1 — PANIC
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Amateur off-center framing, taken from across a small room, accidental ceiling in top of frame"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)",
    "simulated_sensor": "Apple computational photography, Smart HDR 5",
    "lens_simulation": "iPhone 15 Pro 24mm, subtle barrel distortion"
  },
  "scene": "A 20-year-old college student sitting at a messy dorm desk at night, face illuminated by laptop screen glow, expression of pure panic and disbelief. Both hands on their head in a 'we're cooked' gesture. Overhead dorm fluorescent lighting mixed with warm laptop glow. Energy drink cans, scattered papers, highlighters, an unopened textbook. The student is wearing a wrinkled university hoodie with messy hair. Taken by the student's roommate from across the small dorm room. Candid, unposed, genuinely stressed. The desk is chaotic — post-it notes, a dead highlighter, crumpled paper."
}
```

### Slide 2 — THE DREAD
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Close-up, slightly above eye level, friend looking down at them"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Close-up of the same college student's face, head resting on their arms on the desk, looking up at the camera with exhausted dread — the 'I'm about to pull an all-nighter' expression. Only the top half of their face visible above their crossed arms. Their eyes are tired but resigned. A massive stack of printed academic papers and a thick textbook visible on the desk next to their head. A half-crushed energy drink can nearby. Harsh overhead fluorescent dorm lighting casting shadows under their eyes. The photo is intimate and close — their roommate leaned in to capture the misery. Raw, real, relatable."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE GRIND
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Side profile shot, person hunched over desk, atmospheric"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Side profile of a college student hunched over their desk, intensely focused, bathed in the blue-white glow of their laptop screen. It's clearly very late at night — the dorm window behind them is pitch black. Their face shows intense concentration. An energy drink in hand. Papers spread everywhere. A clock or alarm clock on the nightstand showing something like 1:47 AM. The silhouette-like quality of the laptop glow against the dark room creates a moody, atmospheric shot. Taken candidly from the roommate's bed. Slightly grainy from iPhone night mode."
}
```

### Slide 4 — VICTORY
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Selfie-style, front camera, slightly below eye level, amateur framing with too much headroom"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)",
    "simulated_sensor": "Apple front camera processing, slightly softer than rear camera",
    "lens_simulation": "iPhone front camera 12mm equivalent, noticeable wide-angle distortion"
  },
  "scene": "A college student taking a front-camera selfie at their dorm desk, slight smirk of relief and exhausted confidence. Arms raised in a small victory gesture. It's late at night — overhead fluorescent light casts slightly unflattering shadows under their eyes. Messy hair, university hoodie, tired but victorious expression. The selfie is slightly blurry from hand movement. Completely authentic and unpolished — the kind of photo someone would actually post on their Instagram story at 2am with the caption 'done'. Dark circles visible, but genuinely happy."
}
```

## Script 2: "Boss asked how I'm always prepared" (Professional)

### Slide 1 — THE MOMENT
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Candid office shot, taken from hip level as if sneaking a photo, slightly tilted"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A modern open-plan office. A female manager in her 40s is leaning against a standing desk, speaking to a younger employee (mid-20s) with an impressed expression, gesturing as if complimenting them. The younger person looks slightly awkward and flattered, caught off-guard. Glass meeting rooms in the background, blurred coworkers walking past. Overhead office LED panel lighting — flat and corporate. The photo looks like it was sneakily taken by a coworker from a few desks away, slightly obstructed by a monitor edge. Natural, unstaged, candid workplace moment."
}
```

### Slide 2 — MORNING RITUAL
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Flat lay style but messy, taken from directly above with slight shadow from the person's hand"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A top-down photo of a kitchen counter in morning light. A half-drunk coffee in a simple ceramic mug, AirPods case open nearby, a corner of a laptop visible, and a small notebook with a few scribbled notes and article titles. Early morning golden sunlight streaming in from the left casting long soft shadows. The surface has coffee ring stains and a few crumbs. This looks like someone paused their morning routine to take a quick overhead photo for their story. Warm, natural, lived-in. No phone visible — just coffee, notes, and quiet morning productivity energy."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE COMMUTE
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "POV shot from the person's perspective looking forward, knees visible at bottom of frame"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "First-person POV sitting on a commuter train or bus. Looking forward at the morning scene — other commuters visible across the aisle, morning light coming through the train windows creating streaks. The person's knees in business casual pants visible at the bottom of frame, a leather laptop bag between their feet on the floor. AirPods in one ear visible at the edge of the frame. The photo has slight motion blur from the moving train. A smartwatch on the wrist showing 8:15am. Captures the daily commute energy — routine, purposeful, calm. Authentic, everyday, not glamorous."
}
```

### Slide 4 — IN THE MEETING
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Sneaky under-table angle, slightly dark, amateur spy-shot energy"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A photo taken from below table level in a corporate meeting room, angled upward. You can see the edge of a conference table, someone's hands gesturing while speaking, coffee cups, laptops closed or open, and in the background through a glass wall, more office workers. The framing is deliberately bad — like someone held their camera under the table to take a quick photo during a meeting. Overhead panel lighting, slightly washed out. You can see the person's shirt sleeve and watch. The whole thing looks illicit and fun, like someone sneaking a photo to send to a friend saying 'I'm literally the most prepared person here rn'."
}
```

### Slide 5 — THE CONFIDENCE
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Casual desk selfie, webcam-angle, natural office lighting"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A young professional (mid-20s) taking a quick selfie at their office desk, slight confident smile. They're wearing a simple button-down shirt, AirPods in one ear. Office fluorescent lighting from above. A post-it note stuck to their monitor visible over their shoulder. The selfie has typical front-camera quality — slightly soft, wide-angle distortion making their forehead a bit bigger. The kind of casual selfie someone sends their friend on iMessage during work with the text 'just got complimented by my boss again lol'. Natural, not trying hard."
}
```

## Script 3: "ADHD — finished a 20-minute article in 4 minutes" (ADHD/Focus)

### Slide 1 — THE STRUGGLE
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Slightly above eye level, looking down at person, natural overhead angle like a friend standing nearby"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A person in their early 20s lying on their bed or couch, staring at the ceiling with glazed-over unfocused eyes, clearly zoned out. They're in comfortable clothes — oversized t-shirt, messy bun or bedhead. A blanket is tangled around them. The room has warm lamp lighting — not overhead, just a bedside lamp creating soft uneven light. There are a few empty mugs and a water bottle on the nightstand. The expression is relatable frustrated boredom — the look of someone whose brain just won't cooperate. Photo taken by a roommate or partner from a standing position looking down. Intimate, messy, real."
}
```

### Slide 2 — BRAIN WON'T COOPERATE
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Close-up of person's hands and face, frustrated gesture"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Close-up of someone rubbing their temples or pressing their palms against their eyes in frustration. They're sitting at a desk or on their bed. Their body language screams 'I literally cannot focus'. A stack of unread papers or printouts visible in front of them, untouched. Warm bedroom lamp light. Their hair is messy, maybe a scrunchie on their wrist. A cold forgotten cup of tea or coffee beside them. This is the 'I've been staring at the same paragraph for 20 minutes' moment. Candid, intimate, raw frustration. Taken by a friend or partner who caught the moment."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE SHIFT
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Over-the-shoulder, intimate, close framing, person leaning forward"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "The same person has shifted posture — they're sitting up now, leaning slightly forward, visibly engaged and focused on something in front of them. Their body language has completely changed from the previous defeated slouch. Their eyes are locked forward with genuine concentration — not stressed, just absorbed. Warm bedroom lighting. The contrast between this focused posture and the previous defeated one tells the whole story. The photo feels intimate and personal, like a partner or close friend captured this quiet moment of breakthrough. Natural, no posing."
}
```

### Slide 4 — THE EMOTION
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Front-facing, slightly below eye level, capturing genuine emotion"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A front-camera selfie of a person in their early 20s with a genuine expression of amazement and slight emotional overwhelm — like they just experienced something they didn't think was possible. Slightly watery eyes but smiling. They're in their bedroom, warm lamp light, messy background with clothes and books. The selfie is a little too close to their face — classic 'I just need to document this moment' energy. Hair is messy, no makeup, completely authentic. This looks like the kind of photo someone would post on TikTok with the caption 'I just finished an entire article without losing focus once'. Unfiltered, raw, emotional."
}
```

## Script 4: "Roommate thought I was cheating" (Student)

### Slide 1 — THE ACCUSATION
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Candid shot, two people in a dorm room, taken from a third-person angle or propped phone"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Two female college students in a small dorm room. One is at her desk looking defensive with her hands up in an 'I swear I didn't cheat' gesture, the other is standing with arms crossed looking suspicious and disbelieving, eyebrow raised. The room is a typical shared dorm — two beds, string lights on the wall, a tapestry, textbooks everywhere. Overhead fluorescent lighting. Both are in comfortable clothes — sweatpants, oversized tees. The photo looks like it was taken by one of them holding their phone at arm's length to capture the moment of argument. Slightly chaotic energy, totally unposed, mid-conversation."
}
```

### Slide 2 — SHOWING THE PROOF
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Two people huddled together, shot from the side, candid"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Two college students huddled close together on a dorm bed. The person on the left has a smug, vindicated expression — 'told you so' energy. The other person's jaw is literally dropping, eyes wide, one hand covering their open mouth in disbelief. They're reacting to something just shown to them. The photo is taken from the side catching both their reactions perfectly. Dorm room background with fairy lights providing warm ambient light mixed with harsh overhead fluorescent. Natural, candid reaction moment. The kind of photo a third friend would take and caption 'she really just proved her wrong'."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE REACTION
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Close-up selfie, slightly blurry from being taken quickly, chaotic"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A close-up selfie of two college girls — one grinning smugly at the camera doing a peace sign, the other mid-sentence with a shocked and impressed expression, mouth open, one hand on her cheek in disbelief. Classic 'omg' reaction. The selfie is a bit blurry and one of them is partially cut off at the edge — typical rushed friend selfie. Dorm room in the background, slightly messy. Warm lighting from string lights. The photo radiates chaotic best-friend energy. Completely authentic looking — the kind of selfie that goes straight to the group chat."
}
```

### Slide 4 — BOTH HAPPY
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Friend selfie, both looking at camera, cozy dorm vibes"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A front-camera selfie of the two roommates now both smiling and laughing together, the argument clearly resolved. One has her arm around the other. They're both on the dorm bed, blankets visible, fairy lights in the background creating warm bokeh. The photo has genuine warmth — these are friends who just had a funny moment. Slightly wide-angle front camera distortion. The kind of photo that would be posted with the caption 'she uses it now too lmao'. Cozy, authentic, friendship energy."
}
```

## Script 5: "30 articles a day, 45 minutes" (Professional)

### Slide 1 — MORNING SETUP
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Casual morning flat-lay, top-down, person's shadow visible"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Top-down photo of a minimalist morning setup on a white marble or wood kitchen counter. A steaming coffee in a ceramic mug, AirPods case, a small notebook with a pen, and a corner of a laptop visible. Early morning golden sunlight from a window casting long warm shadows across the surface. A few coffee drips on the counter. The person's shadow is cast over part of the scene. This looks like a quick morning routine photo someone posted to Instagram stories with the caption 'morning grind'. Clean but not staged — there's a crumb, a used paper towel at the edge. Real, aspirational but achievable."
}
```

### Slide 2 — THE FOCUS
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Side profile, person at kitchen table, morning light wrapping around them"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Side profile of a person in their late 20s sitting at a kitchen table in the early morning. Beautiful golden morning sunlight streaming through a window, lighting up one side of their face. They're wearing a comfortable t-shirt, hair slightly messy, looking down with intense focus — deeply absorbed in reading. A coffee mug in one hand. AirPods in. The scene is peaceful and productive — this is someone's quiet morning ritual before the chaos of the day starts. The light is warm and cinematic but the overall vibe is still iPhone-casual. A partner or roommate captured this candid moment from across the kitchen."
}
```

### Slide 3 — CHECKING THE TIME
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Wrist-level shot of smartwatch, background blurred"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A close-up of a person's wrist wearing an Apple Watch showing 7:42 AM. Their hand is wrapped around a coffee mug. The background is blurred but shows a bright kitchen with morning light. The implication is clear — it's not even 8am and they're already done with their morning reading routine. The watch face is in focus, everything else soft. Quick, casual wrist shot — the kind of photo someone takes to flex their early-morning productivity. Natural lighting, unforced."
}
```

### Slide 4 — THE FLEX
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Selfie, morning vibes, casual confidence, coffee-toast"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A young professional (late 20s) taking a front-camera selfie at a home office desk or kitchen table, slight confident smirk, coffee cup raised like a toast to the camera. They're in casual morning clothes — a nice t-shirt, hair done but not perfectly. Morning sunlight on their face creating a warm glow. The selfie has a 'good morning I'm already winning' energy. Slightly wide-angle front camera distortion. AirPods visible. Natural, not over-produced. The kind of story post that says 'already read 30 articles, what did you do before 8am?'"
}
```

## Script 6: "This app forces your brain to read" (ADHD/Focus)

### Slide 1 — THE MYSTERY
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Dark room, person lit from below by unseen light source, moody and mysterious"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A person in a dark room, their face lit from below by a soft glow (as if from a device, but the device itself is not visible — only the light it casts). Their eyes are wide and locked forward, completely absorbed. The uplight creates dramatic shadows on their face. The background is completely dark. The expression is almost trance-like — deep focus, slightly intense. This looks like a partner captured them in a moment of total absorption — someone who literally cannot look away from what they're reading. Intimate, slightly eerie in how focused they look. Dark, moody, iPhone night mode grain."
}
```

### Slide 2 — LOCKED IN
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Close-up of eyes, reflecting light, sharp focus on the eyes only"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "Extreme close-up of a person's eyes. They are intensely focused, pupils dilated, a faint reflection of light visible in their eyes. The rest of their face fades into soft focus and shadow. The eyes tell the whole story — this person is completely locked in, reading something with total concentration. Slight natural skin texture visible — pores, a small blemish, real skin. The lighting is moody and warm from a single source below. This is a dramatic, almost artistic candid shot — but taken on an iPhone. Feels like someone got very close to capture this moment of pure focus."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE HYPNOSIS
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Person from behind/side, silhouetted, staring at unseen light"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A silhouette of a person sitting on a bed or couch in a completely dark room. They are backlit slightly by the glow from something they're looking at (not visible). Their posture is straight and alert — leaning slightly forward, completely still, like a person who cannot look away. The shape of their body against the faint glow creates a striking silhouette. The room is dark except for this single glow. This captures the 'hypnotic' quality of one-word-at-a-time reading — the person is in a trance of focus. Moody, atmospheric, taken on iPhone with night mode grain."
}
```

### Slide 4 — AMAZEMENT
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Front camera selfie, person looking amazed, casual setting"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A front-camera selfie of someone on their couch, looking genuinely amazed and a little breathless — the expression of someone who just finished something they didn't expect to be able to do. A blanket around them, warm living room lighting. A half-eaten snack on the couch next to them. Their expression says 'wait... I actually just did that?' Slightly wide-angle, unpolished, authentic. The kind of selfie someone takes immediately after an experience to capture the raw reaction before it fades."
}
```

## Script 7: "2.8 GPA to Dean's List" (Student)

### Slide 1 — ROCK BOTTOM
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Blurry, dark, slightly out of focus — aesthetically 'depressed era' vibes"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 14 Pro (low-light auto mode)",
    "simulated_sensor": "Apple night mode with slight grain"
  },
  "scene": "A dimly lit dorm room desk at night. Energy drink cans piled up, an unopened textbook with the spine uncracked, crumpled papers, a dead highlighter. No person visible — just the sad, defeated desk that tells the whole story. The photo is intentionally dark, slightly grainy, taken at night with iPhone night mode. The vibe is rock bottom. A cheap desk lamp providing the only light, casting harsh shadows. This looks like a 'this was my lowest point' photo someone saved in their camera roll to remember where they started. Melancholic, real."
}
```

### Slide 2 — OVERWHELMED
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Casual shot of a person surrounded by textbooks, looking overwhelmed"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A college student sitting on the floor of their dorm room surrounded by stacked textbooks, printed articles, and scattered notebooks. They're looking at the pile with a 'how am I going to do all this' expression — head in hands, not dramatic, just genuinely overwhelmed. They're in sweats and a hoodie. The room has typical dorm lighting — harsh overhead mixed with warm desk lamp. Laundry basket overflowing in the corner, empty coffee cups. This is a candid 'my roommate caught me having a moment' photo. Authentic, relatable, the universal college experience."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE TURNAROUND
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Clean study setup photo, morning light, organized energy"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A noticeably cleaner, more organized desk setup. Morning sunlight coming through a dorm window. A laptop open, a proper coffee mug (not an energy drink), and a notebook with actual neat notes — underlines, highlights, page references. The vibe has shifted from the previous slides — this is the 'after' energy. Still a dorm room, still not perfect, but organized and purposeful. The light is warmer, the energy is better. A few colorful tabs sticking out of a textbook showing it's actually been read. Like a 'new semester new me' photo someone would post. Natural, not styled."
}
```

### Slide 4 — THE WIN
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Bright, celebratory, slightly overexposed from flash"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max with flash",
    "simulated_sensor": "Apple flash photography — slightly washed out skin, red-eye reduction artifacts"
  },
  "scene": "A college student holding up a letter or printed notification, huge genuine grin, maybe a tear in their eye. The photo is taken with iPhone flash — creating that typical harsh, slightly unflattering but joyful look of real celebratory photos. Their dorm room or apartment hallway behind them. They're in casual clothes, this was an unplanned celebration. Friends' hands visible reaching into frame to high-five or hug. The flash makes it look amateur and REAL — this is exactly how actual celebration photos look on iPhone. Overexposed, slightly unflattering lighting, but radiating pure joy and achievement."
}

## Script 8: "CEO asked how I always know what's going on" (Professional)

### Slide 1 — THE ENCOUNTER
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {

  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A corporate office. Through a glass meeting room wall, you can see a person in business casual talking with an older executive type in a suit jacket. The photo is taken from outside the glass — there are reflections and the view is partially obstructed by a desk plant or monitor. The body language suggests the executive is leaning in, interested, asking the younger person something. Other employees visible at their desks in the foreground, slightly blurred. Standard office LED panel lighting. This looks like someone at their desk sneakily photographed an important interaction — the kind of photo you'd send to a friend saying 'THE CEO JUST TALKED TO ME WTF'. Low-quality, sneaky, excited energy."

    "composition_guide": "POV commuter shot, looking forward at the train/bus, atmospheric"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "First-person POV on a subway or bus, looking out the window at a city passing by in morning light. AirPods visible at the edge of the frame (in the person's ear). Their business casual sleeve and smartwatch visible. Other commuters blurred in the peripheral — someone reading a newspaper, someone sleeping. Morning golden light streaming through the windows creating beautiful streaks. The train or bus is in motion — slight blur on the passing cityscape outside. This captures the daily ritual — the calm productive commute. Authentic, everyday, peaceful. No devices visible, just the moment."

### Slide 3 — THE PREPARED NOTEBOOK
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Top-down desk shot, notebook with notes, meeting context visible"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A top-down photo of a notebook on a conference table with handwritten notes — bullet points, article references, underlined key stats, arrows connecting ideas. The handwriting looks natural and real — slightly messy but organized. A coffee cup, a pen, and other meeting attendees' hands/arms visible around the table. The notebook shows someone who came PREPARED. The photo is taken looking down at your own notebook during a meeting, a bit sneaky, like documenting your own quiet flex. Conference room lighting, slightly blue from a presentation screen. Quick, casual, work-context photo."
}
```

### Slide 4 — WALKING OUT CONFIDENT
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Motion blur walking shot, urban background, slight tilt"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A photo taken while walking on a city sidewalk — slight motion blur on the background which shows a glass office building exterior and city trees. The person's blazer sleeve and a coffee cup in hand visible at the edge. AirPods in ear visible at the top. Morning city light. The stride is confident, purposeful. This captures the 'main character walking to work' energy. Urban, professional, efficient. Slightly blurry, slightly tilted, authentic movement. The kind of photo someone takes of themselves mid-walk feeling like they're winning at life."

## Script 9: "Delete your Read Later list" (Viral/Productivity)

### Slide 1 — THE SHAME
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Person at desk, head in hands, surrounded by scattered papers and bookmarks"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A person sitting at a messy desk, head in hands, surrounded by an absurd number of printed articles, bookmarked magazines, torn-out newspaper clippings, and sticky notes with article titles written on them. The physical representation of an overwhelming 'read later' pile. The stack is comically large — teetering, some falling off the desk. The person's expression (visible through their fingers) is overwhelmed resignation. Natural daylight from a window. The photo is candid and slightly humorous — someone captured their friend's article-hoarding shame. Relatable, slightly embarrassing, funny."
}
```

### Slide 2 — THE PILE
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Dramatic angle on a huge stack of unread material, shot from below to make it look even bigger"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A dramatic low-angle photo of a massive stack of books, printed articles, magazines, and notebooks — shot from below to make the pile look intimidatingly tall. The stack is on a desk or table, slightly leaning and chaotic. Post-it notes and bookmarks sticking out everywhere, all unread. A coffee mug barely visible behind the stack for scale. Natural lighting from a window. The whole vibe is 'this is what months of saving things to read later actually looks like in real life'. Overwhelming, humorous, relatable. The low angle makes it feel like a mountain you'll never climb."
}
```

### Slide 3 — THE LIBERATION
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Bright, clean, airy — dramatic contrast from the cluttered previous slides"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max (Raw Mode)"
  },
  "scene": "A dramatically clean and empty desk. The same desk from before, but now cleared off — just a laptop, a single coffee mug, and a small plant. Bright natural daylight flooding in from a window. The surface is clean and spacious. The energy is light, free, unburdened — the opposite of the cluttered mess before. This is the 'after' photo — the reading list is conquered. The bright lighting and clean space create a feeling of relief and fresh starts. Simple, satisfying, aspirational. Like a 'that girl' aesthetic photo but authentic and not overly curated."
}
```

### Slide 4 — THE SATISFACTION
```json
{
  "frame_initialization": {
    "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
    "composition_guide": "Selfie, person looking relieved and satisfied, clean background"
  },
  "hardware_and_optical_fidelity": {
    "camera_tier": "iPhone 15 Pro Max front camera (12MP TrueDepth)"
  },
  "scene": "A front-camera selfie of someone sitting at their now-clean desk, looking directly at the camera with a satisfied, slightly smug expression. A small smile that says 'I actually did it'. Behind them is the clean, organized space. Good natural lighting on their face. They look relaxed and unburdened — the weight of 200 unread articles has been lifted. The selfie is casual and quick — the kind someone takes to post with the caption 'cleared my entire reading list in one weekend, AMA'. Slightly wide-angle front camera distortion. Genuine, not performative."
}
```

## Usage Notes

### How to use these prompts:
1. Copy the JSON prompt for each slide
2. Paste into Google Gemini / NanoBanana Pro
3. Download the generated 9:16 image
4. Add text overlays in CapCut or TikTok's editor (DO NOT bake text into the AI image)
5. Compile slides into a TikTok photo carousel
6. Add trending audio
7. Post via Postiz

### Key principles:
- **NO phone screens or app UIs** — those always look obviously AI
- Text overlays added AFTER in CapCut/TikTok editor
- iPhone camera tier is the secret sauce for authentic-looking photos
- "Amateur off-center framing" and "slightly tilted" make it look real
- Front camera selfies use "12MP TrueDepth" for authentic distortion
- Flash photos = slightly overexposed + unflattering = real
- Every photo should look like it came from someone's actual camera roll
- Messy backgrounds, imperfect lighting, real skin texture = authenticity
