## Caption
Delete your "Read Later" list. You're never going back to it. Unless you have Speed Read. Then it takes 2 minutes per article. No excuses. #productivity #readlater #reading #lifehack #organization #speedreading #savingthings

## Notes
- Hot takes / controversial openers drive engagement (comments = algorithm fuel)
- "You've been saving articles for months, you've read zero" is personally attacking everyone watching
- People will comment "I feel called out" — that's the goal
- Key emotion: guilt → motivation → relief
