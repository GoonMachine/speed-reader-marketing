# TikTok Content Generation — Speed Read RSVP

Generate viral TikTok content that drives downloads of Speed Read RSVP.

## The App
Speed Read RSVP lets you share any article from Safari, X, or any app and read it word-by-word at 300-500+ WPM using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation). It eliminates eye movement — words appear one at a time in the center of your screen. Free to try, $2.99/week or $9.99/month.

## Content Strategy

### Volume
- **3 posts per day minimum** — morning (8am), afternoon (1pm), evening (7pm)
- Let the algorithm decide winners — most will flop, some will hit 100K+
- When one hits, make 5 variations immediately

### Target Audiences (rotate between these)
1. **College students** — drowning in readings, cramming, research papers
2. **Professionals** — staying informed, email overload, meeting prep
3. **ADHD/Focus** — can't read long articles, mind wanders, need structure
4. **Productivity nerds** — optimize everything, lifehacks, self-improvement

### Content Formats

#### Format 1: POV / Storytime (HIGHEST CONVERTING)
Hook-driven relatable scenario. Fabricate a specific, believable situation.
- 15-30 seconds
- Text overlay on screen recording of the app
- First-person narrative

#### Format 2: Before/After
Split-screen or sequential showing the pain → the solution.
- 10-20 seconds
- Side-by-side comparison
- Dramatic speed difference

#### Format 3: Challenge / Flex
"Watch me read this entire article in 2 minutes" — screen record the app in action.
- 15-45 seconds
- Real-time demo with timer
- Satisfying to watch

#### Format 4: Tip / Hack
Position as a productivity tip, app is the punchline.
- 10-20 seconds
- "Hack I wish I knew sooner"
- Educational angle

## Script Template

```
HOOK (0-2 seconds):
[The hook line — this is EVERYTHING. Must stop the scroll.]

SETUP (2-5 seconds):
[Brief context that builds tension or curiosity]

REVEAL (5-10 seconds):
[Show the app / demonstrate the solution]

PROOF (10-20 seconds):
[Screen recording of Speed Read in action — show the speed]

CTA (last 2-3 seconds):
[Call to action — "Link in bio" / "Speed Read RSVP on the App Store"]
```

## Script Generation Instructions

When generating a script:

1. **Pick an audience** — rotate between student, professional, ADHD, productivity
2. **Pick a hook** from the library above OR generate a new one following the patterns
3. **Write the full script** using the template
4. **Include visual directions** — what's on screen at each moment
5. **Keep it under 30 seconds** — shorter performs better
6. **End with CTA** — always drive to the App Store

### Hook Rules
- First 2 seconds decide everything — front-load the most compelling part
- Use "POV:", "How I...", or direct address ("You need to...")
- Create a knowledge gap — make them NEED to keep watching
- Specificity sells — "200 pages" beats "a lot of reading"
- Emotion over logic — frustration, surprise, relief, FOMO

### What NOT to Do
- Don't explain RSVP technology — nobody cares HOW it works
- Don't lead with the app name — lead with the PROBLEM
- Don't make it feel like an ad — make it feel like a story
- Don't use generic hooks — "This app is amazing" = instant scroll
- Don't be longer than 30 seconds unless it's a banger storytime

## Batch Generation

When generating a batch of content, produce a set of 9 scripts (3 days worth):
- 3 student-focused
- 3 professional-focused
- 2 ADHD/focus-focused
- 1 productivity/viral wildcard

Output each script as a separate markdown file in `data/content-queue/` with naming:
`YYYY-MM-DD-{N}-{audience}-{slug}.md`

Example: `2026-02-13-1-student-200-pages-tonight.md`

## Performance Tracking

After posting, track in `data/performance/`:
- Hook used
- Audience targeted
- Views at 24h
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- App Store clicks (if trackable)
- Subscriptions attributed

Double down on hooks that get >10K views. Kill patterns that consistently underperform.
